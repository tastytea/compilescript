= compilescript

*compilescript* allows you to execute files from compiled languages as scripts.
By default it uses `g++`.

It compiles the source file, stores the binary in
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/compilescript/` and executes it. If the binary in cache is
newer than the source file, the compilation is skipped.

== Usage
